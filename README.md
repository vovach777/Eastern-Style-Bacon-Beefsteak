#### **Technological Process:**

1. **Preparation of Ingredients:**
   - Roll the bacon into a cylinder and slice into 2–3 mm thick rounds to create "bacon noodles."  
   - Add the egg, black pepper, and Sichuan pepper to the ground beef and lamb. Mix thoroughly.  
   - Add the sliced bacon to the mixture and combine until evenly distributed.  

2. **Beefsteak Formation:**
   - Form the prepared mixture into an oval-shaped patty (~2 cm thick).

   **A. Skillet + Oven**  
   - Heat a skillet with a small amount of oil.  
   - Sear the beefsteak on both sides for 2–3 minutes until golden brown.

   **B. Grill**  
   - Preheat a grill with double-sided cooking functionality.  
   - Place the patties on the grill surface.  
   - Cook for 4–5 minutes until fully done. Check the internal temperature — it should reach 70°C (158°F).  

4. **Serving:**
   - Place the beefsteak in the center of the plate, with a portion of coleslaw next to it.
